Data structures and algorithms notes

Make note of 
1. Iterative solution present in Mathematics/Power.java
2. Brian Kernighan's algorithm in Bitwise/CountSetBits.java
3. Use of XOR operator in Bitwise/OneOddOccurring.java
4. Finding last set bit in Bitwise/TwoOddOccurring.java
5. Trapping water in Arrays/TrappingWater.java

Arrays can be static or dynamic in java. 
Dynamic lists - arraylist 
Static lists- array[]
The internal implementation of dynamic list is - the size of the array doubles when the maximum limit is reached.
